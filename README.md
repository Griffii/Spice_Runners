# **Spice Runners**

*Spice Runners* is a top-down 2D strategy game inspired by *Dune*. As the pilot of a **thopter**, you’ll soar over vast, shifting sands, scanning for **spice deposits**.
Your mission? Protect your crawlers from **sand worms** and build your fortune as a spice trader.

### **Gameplay Overview**
- **Survey and Deploy:** When you locate spice, deploy **spice crawlers** to harvest it. 
- **Stay Alert:** The longer the crawler stays on the ground, the greater the chance of a **worm attack**.
- **Act Fast:** Monitor worm signs, call in carriers to evacuate crawlers, and make split-second decisions to ensure survival.

Every moment is a balancing act of **resource management**, **risk assessment**, and **strategic planning**.

### **Dynamic Gameplay Features**
- **Procedurally Generated Maps:** Each mission offers a unique challenge—no two runs are the same.

    
### **Upgrades and Hazards**
Customize your strategy with powerful upgrades:
- **Thumpers** to distract sandworms.
- **Radios** for early detection of worm signs.
- **Spice Storage Upgrades** to maximize profits.

But beware—this unforgiving desert is teeming with hazards...

Will you build a legacy among the sands, or will the desert claim everything?
